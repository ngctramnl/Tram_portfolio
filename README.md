# Project 1: Hotel_bookings
# About Dataset
- The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019
- The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020

# Inspiration
- Practice with exploratory data analysis (EDA)

# Deliverables
- How do the hotel stays of guests with/without children vary throughout the year? Is this different in the city and the resort hotel?
- Are hotel guests with children more likely to require a parking space?
- The relationship between guests with chidren and their spendings


# Technology Perception
# About Dataset
- Collected from a survey primarily conducted in India
- Survey data was collected to measure technology usage patterns, perceived benefits, perceived risks, perceived barriers, likeliness to adopt, likeliness to recommend, etc.


# Deliverables
The goals are to identify factors influencing technology adoptions and recommendation behaviours among consumer households. The deliverables are to help IT product developers strategically design and position IT solutions.

# Findings
- There is no significant difference in LikelinessToAdopt between males and females. It indicates that gender may not be a strong determinant in individuals' likeliness to adopt new technology.
- There is no significant difference in LikelinessToAdopt among education-level groups. It indicates that education level may not be a strong determinant in individuals' likeliness to adopt new technology.
- Based on the regression model, the frequency of using wearable devices is positively associated with the likeliness to adopt. With each unit increased in frequency, the likeliness to adopt increased by 0.16. The perceived benefit in productivity and efficiency is the most important factor influencing the likeliness to adopt technology among consumer households.


# Implementations
1. Businessesâ€™ content and copies should focus on the productivity/efficiency the IT solutions can bring to consumers
2. Cater to the subsets group of people who use wearable devices frequently. Product developers might create IT solutions that are integrated with devices such as fitness activity trackers
